An example containing a clickable reference[^1] with a link to the source.

Second example containing a reference[^2] with a link to the source.

[^1]: Reference first footnote with a return to content link.

If you check out this example in `src/content/post/markdown-elements/index.md`, you'll notice that the references and the heading "Footnotes" are added to the bottom of the page via the [remark-rehype](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-rehype#options) plugin.

## Lists

Unordered

- Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
- Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
- Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
1. Consectetur adipiscing elit
1. Integer molestie lorem at massa
1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

1. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

```
// Some comments
line 1 of code
line 2 of code
line 3 of code
```

Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

```
var foo = function (bar) {
 return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
