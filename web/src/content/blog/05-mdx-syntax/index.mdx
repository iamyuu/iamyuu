MDX is an extension of Markdown with the ability to import `.astro`,
`.jsx`, `.tsx` and other framework components you have integrated.

This guide covers the basics of MDX syntax and how to use it, as well as a few examples.

## Example 1

Importing a component from the `/components` directory.

This component accepts a Javascript date object and format it as a string.

```astro
import DateComp from "../../../components/FormattedDate.astro";

<DateComp date={new Date()} />
```

import FormattedDate from "../../../components/FormattedDate.astro";

<FormattedDate date={new Date()} />

---

## Example 2

Importing a component from a relative path to your content.

This component displays an alert when the button is clicked.

```astro
import RelativeComponent from "./component.astro";

<RelativeComponent />
```

import RelativeComponent from "./component.astro";

<RelativeComponent />

By default Micro has zero frameworks installed. If you install a framework, components of that framework can be used in MDX files.

<Callout>
  Don't forget to use [client
  directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives)
  to make framework components interactive.
</Callout>

```astro
<ReactComponent client:load />
```
