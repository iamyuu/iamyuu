## Background

In short background, before I wrote this article, a few day ago I got "laid off" ðŸ¥² and I haven't done any coding test or interview test for a long time. So, I need to refresh coding test knowledge for prepare the next interview coding test, maybe from essential CS (Computer Science) knowledge to algorithms and data structures, and maybe HR (Human Resource) interview questions.

But why did you create this article, instead of focusing on learning and practicing it? Well, when I wrote this article, I hope it would also help other people who were "laid off" or for fresh graduates, and in the other hand, just in case I need it again in the future.
