## Working with the `blog` collection:

The `blog` collection is found in `src/content/blog`.

```
📁 /src/content/blog
└── 📁 post-1
      └── 📄 index.md
└── 📁 post-2
      └── 📄 index.mdx
```

In the above example, two blog posts will be generated with the folder name representing the id.

- `https://example.com/blog/post-1`
- `https://example.com/blog/post-2`

---

## Provide metadata

Metadata is required for each post.

```astro
---
title: "Blog Collection";
description: "How to add posts to the blog.";
date: "2024-03-21";
draft: false;
tags:
  - tutorial
---
```

| Field       | Req | Type    | Remarks                                          |
| :---------- | :-- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| title       | Yes | string  | Title of the content. Used in SEO and RSS.       |
| description | Yes | string  | Description of the content. Used in SEO and RSS. |
| date        | Yes | string  | Must be a valid date string (able to be parsed). |
| draft       | No  | boolean | If draft: true, content will not be published.   |
| tags        | No  | string array | Tags to organize content |

---

All that's left to do is write the content under the metadata.

```astro
---
title: "Blog Collection";
description: "How to add posts to the blog.";
date: "2024-03-21";
draft: false;
