A curious person, love to learn how things work, in love with software engineering with a strong passion to learn new things. Not a fan of any framework out there. Looking for fun
and challenging projects to work on. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge projects and create impactful software solutions. Starting a career as a back-end engineer and now
focusing on front-end engineering.
